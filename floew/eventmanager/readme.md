This diagram describes the structure of data within a single document, focusing on the relationship between Event Managers, Organisations, Contacts, Events, and SignUp Participants. An **EventManager** is associated with a single **Organisation** and manages a list of **Events**. Each **Organisation** has a **Contact** person associated with it. An **Event** can have multiple **SignUp Participants**. All relationships represented by solid lines indicate that these entities are contained within the main document or are directly related within the same data structure, rather than being linked through external foreign keys. For example, an EventManager document would embed or directly reference the Organisation and the list of Events it manages. Similarly, an Organisation document would contain the Contact details, and an Event document would contain the list of SignUp Participants.
